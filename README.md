_Games-Of-Life_
------
__Description__  
Runs and displays information about various different types of "Game of Life" simulations.  
One example of "Game of Life" is Conway's Game of Life which is often displayed in two dimensions.  
  
This program will contain multiple different games of life using different rulesets and in either two or three dimensions. (Sometimes in both)  
  
*Note that this program requires Java 8 in order to run.*

__Sample Images__  
Images saved using the program's own save feature, that I have found to be good samples of the program's capabilities over the development process can be found here: ALBUM TO BE CREATED SOON  
  
*Please note that the .gitignore has an entry to ignore all .png files inside the desktop section of the project. This is to prevent any pictures taken during testing/development to be pushed to the repository.*
